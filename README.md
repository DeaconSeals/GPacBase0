# SETTING UP GIT SSH ACCESS

GitHub, starting the Friday before this semester starts, has stopped accepting passwords for command-line access, so you'll need to set up an SSH key pair. If you already have one set up (or prefer to use an access token) you can skip this part. Open a terminal and enter these commands:

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_github@email.address"
```
Give it whatever filename you want. Then go to https://github.com/settings/keys and make a new ssh key. Give it a name, then put in the public key (this can be found by executing `cat filename.pub`) and save the key. Then enter these commands:
```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
Now your SSH key should be set up. Note that you may need to execute `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"` every time you restart your environment.

# SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

First, read SUBMISSIONRULES.txt to understand how submissions work in this course, then continue with the rest of these instructions.

If you're not familiar with git, this first assignment will help you with the basics. If you're already familiar with git, make sure to still finish the assignment by running finalize.sh then pushing your repository, but you can skip the rest of these instructions.

Go to your new repository. In the top right of the repository should be a Code button. Click it, go to the SSH tab, and copy to your keyboard. Open a terminal and enter these commands:
```
cd ~/Desktop
git clone your-copied-address-here
```
Now your repository is on your desktop. You'll do this every time you start on a new assignment. Open a terminal in the repository (or `cd` to it) and run finalize.sh:
```
chmod 755 finalize.sh
./finalize.sh
```
After finishing the script, you should now have readyToSubmit.txt in your repository. Check that it's there and has your username. Now, use `git add *`. This command tells git to keep track of every file in the repository -- you will need to execute this any time you make new files. Then, `git commit -m "whatever message you want to type"`. This makes a new commit, which saves the state of the repository. Make a new commit every time you make a major change to your submissions, and write a short description of your changes in the message. Finally, `git push origin`. This uploads all your new commits to GitHub. Make sure to push when you're ready to finally submit an assignment. You can also push after every commit, if you want. Give it a few seconds, and refresh the repository in your browser. Make sure readyToSubmit.txt is there, and you're done!
